# odin-recipes
An introductory project from ODIN to practice html and using github.

Project purpose and skills to learn:
- Using git in the command line to maintain a project on Github
- Using the commandline to practice navigating the filesystem and manipulating files
- Learning the basic structure of HTML and creating a small showcase example which in the future will be improved with CSS elements
- Learning to write good commit comments (this will be useful for my coworkers and for my own future self in managing snapshots of projects, and to lessen the time required to understand why a commit was made.)
- This is about all I can think of right now, might modify in the future. 
In this moment, I think these are my main learning objectives for this lesson. 
Thank you for reading.
